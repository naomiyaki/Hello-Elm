# Hello-Elm
Quick Elm Starter Kit with Webpack and webpack-dev-server

It took a bit of tinkering to get a simple Elm project working using the documentation I could find for elm-webpack-loader, so I made a very simple one based on the intro structure used in the [https://pragmaticstudio.com/elm](Pragmatic Studio tutorial) (with a src folder for added organization).

This doesn't provide ES6, SCSS, or any other kind of transpilatory goodness, but it should be easy to add.
